# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This was a project to evaluate a small kickstarter data set to try to understand factors that play a role in a kickstarter's success or failure.  Specifically, much of the focus of this project was in the category of theater and subcategory plays.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to test whether we could implement concepts learned in the module lessons to provide two different analyses.  The purpose of the analyses was to see if we could glean useful information from analyzing previous kickstarter outcomes based on launch date and from analyzing previous kickstarter outcomes based on the initial dollar goals of those projects.   

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
