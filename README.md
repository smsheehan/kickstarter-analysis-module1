# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that enables entrepreneurs to attract funding to help bring a project or product from idea to implementation.  According to wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter, since July 2021 there have been approximately 205,00 successfully funded projects which makes this an interesting data set for learning data analytics skills.  This was a project to evaluate a kickstarter data set to try to understand factors that play a role in a kickstarter's success or failure.  Specifically, much of the focus of this project was in the category of theater and subcategory plays.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to test whether we could implement concepts learned in the module lessons to provide two different analyses.  The purpose of the analyses was to see if we could glean useful information from analyzing previous kickstarter outcomes based on launch date and from analyzing previous kickstarter outcomes based on the initial dollar goals of those projects.  This was done under the auspices of helping our fictional friend, Louise, understand if these two variables (launch date, funding goal) impacted the success of projects on kickstarter. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis starts with the need to take our "Date Created Conversion" column in which we had previously converted date from unix format, and extract out just the year.  The function used to do this was straightforward.  All of the functions written for this assignment can be found in the Excel workbook located at https://github.com/smsheehan/kickstarter-analysis-module1/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.zip.   I then created a pivot table and applied appropriate filters and sorting to achieve the following table

After ensuring the table was correctly displayed, I used the Insert tab in excel to create a line chart, which looked like this:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis required the creation of 8 columns (Goals, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Canceled, Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, Percentage Canceled) in a new sheet and I needed to create functions extract the relevant information for the subcategory "plays" from the main kickstarter data worksheet.  For the Number Successful/Failed/Canceled columns, this was accomplished using the countifs function.  Here is a representative countifs function for the Number Successful column:  
All of the functions can be viewed in the Excel workbook located at https://github.com/smsheehan/kickstarter-analysis-module1/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.zip.  The remaining columns required only simple math functions to calculate the sum and percentage where appropriate.  I then inserted a line chart which looked like this:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge associate with this assignment was getting comfortable with writing functions that pull data from a different worksheet.  Having never done this before, it took some time for me to get used to the fact that the function input line from the page you are typing in persists when you click into a different worksheet to select cells.  The other challenge was that it took me some time to understand how to copy and paste functions from one cell to another without disrupting the original function.  Specifically I realized that once I have copied a formula, I need to "unhighlight" the original formula before clicking into another cell, otherwise the original formula will be replaced with the name of the cell that I was clicking into.  This makes sense based on the functionality that allows us to build our functions by clicking into cells, but took some time for me to get used to this.  The biggest difficulty I ran into was making sure the column formatting was appropriate.  For example, when extracting the year from the "Date Created Conversion" column, my output wasn't displaying properly because I kept trying to format the column as a date.  It took me a while to realize that the proper column format needed to be  "general" in order to correctly display the year.  Additionally , in creating percentages, I multiplied by 100 to create the percentage withing the function.  However, when I first created my line chart I noticed the Y axis didn't display the percentage symbol which would make the chart confusing to the reader.  I then realized I needed to remove the times 100 from my function and format the receiving column as percentage.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The first conclusion that can be drawn is that in the "theater" category, there is higher overall launch of new projects in the month of May and the fewest number of new projects launched in the month of December.  The second conclusion that can be drawn is that the success rate for launched products is highest in the month of May and lowest success rate is seen for projects launched in December.  Another observation is that the number of cancelled projects in this category is comparatively low and fairly consistent across the months.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
It can be concluded that projects in the subcategory of "plays" with goals of less than 5000, have historically had the highest success rate.  Projects with goals between 5000 and 19,999 dollars have historically had 50% or greater success rate.  In general, it appears that as the goal amounts get higher, the percent of successful projects get lower.  There are two exceptions to this with the categories of 35,000 to 39,999 dollars and 40,000 to 44,999 dollars both having a 67% successful rate.  However, since these two categories only have 6 and 3 total projects respectively, it would be unwise to make a conclusion about these two dollar amount categories based on so few data points.  

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The biggest limitation of the dataset is that it is too limited to enable you to determine anything more than correlation.  For example, just because we can find a correlation between success rate and a specific launch date it does not mean that we can conclude that launching in May will give a new project a higher chance for success.  Intuitively we know that success or failure is based on a multitude of factors, not the least of which are quality of the proposal (including how well written the proposal is), how innovative the proposal is, and the percieved likelihood the project can actually be brought to life.  Without any contextual information about these more subjective factors, the current data set forces us to assume that all of these other factors are evenly distributed throughout projects.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It would be interesting to evaluate if there are any trends that can be seen based on duration of the funding campaign.  This would be accomplished by taking the difference of the end date and launch date and then comparing that vs success rates.  Additionally one could look at difference in trends between US and campaigns from Great Britton.  Another interesting approach would be to use some type of natural language processing tool to see if the blurbs could be bucketed by themes or keywords and then look to see if there are trends in success rates based off those nlp generated categories.  Lastly, it would be particularly interesting to look exclusively at projects which exceeded their goals to see if there are trends based on launch date, or goals, or the above described nlp generated categories based on the blurbs.
